# MD6 Perl module fail to install (syntax error in : inc/Devel/CheckLib.pm)


### The problem:

when I run ``perl -MCPAN -Mlocal::lib=${PERL5LIB%/lib/perl5} -e "CPAN::install(Digest::MD6)"``
<br>I got this :

```log

```

## solution:

```sh
export PERL5LIB=${PERL5LIB:-$HOME/site/lib/perl5}

#go to the cpan/build folder :
cd $(ls -1d ~/.cpan/build/Digest-MD6-0.11-*/ | head -1)
# name inc folder into in_
mv inc in_
perl -MCPAN -Mlocal::lib=${PERL5LIB%/lib/perl5} -e "CPAN::install(Devel::CheckLib)"
perl Makefile.PL
make -f Makefile
make test
sudo make install
```
