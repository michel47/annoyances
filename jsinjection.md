## trying to inject some js within github pages


### question: 

 * do we have the option of running a js w/i [github.com][gh] ?
<br>(note: it is obviously possible on [github.io][ghp] pages)

 testing : ``<script> console.log('hello you !')</script>``
<script> console.log('hello you !')</script>
is seems that the tags <tag> are escaped !
